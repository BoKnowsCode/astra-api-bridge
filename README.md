This is a middleware solution that leverages the [facade pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) to provide a simplified RESTful API on top of the existing Astra Schedule API

# Get Started

#### 1. Initial Setup

Configure your Astra Schedule envrionment with a username and password that can be used for authentication from this middleware. Consider establishing a 'guest' account with access limited to data that you intend to surface from this facade middleware.  

#### 2. Clone the project

`git clone https://github.com/adastradev/astra-api-facade.git`

#### 3. Install all dependencies
Change into the project directory (e.g. `cd astra-api-facade`) and run `npm install`

#### 4. Configure authentication

Create a file called `.env` and configure it with the site, username, and password you would like to use to connect to the Astra Schedule API (do not include the brackets)

```
API_USER=[replace_with_username]
API_PASSWORD=[replace with_password]
API_SITE=[replace with site url]
```

#### 5. Run the tests  
`npm run test` - this will confirm environment data (username/password) is properly read and can connect to Astra Schedule and retrieve data

# Run
`npm start`

This will run the app locally.  Open `http://localhost:3000` using a web browser to confirm that the middleware is running.  You should see [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) documentation for the Astra API Facade.  

Browse and test the API right from your browser using the Swaggger UI.  You can also utilize a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test and validate the facade.  

Running the app in dev mode (`npm dev`) will cause the Node.js app to automatically reload as you make code changes.  If you are testing API from a browser, you will have to refresh the browser page or modify this project to do browser reloading also.

# Deploy

Instructions for deployment will be added here, stay tuned!
